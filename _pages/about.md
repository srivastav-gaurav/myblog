Versatile individual with experience in collecting, transforming and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions. Excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analyses, including SQL, Excel spreadsheet, tableau and R. Strong communication and organizational and analytical skills. Recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate -a rigorous and hands-on program that covers the entire scope of data analysis process. Also, knowledge of machine learning algorithms and proficiency in Python programming and common libraries. Currently doing [fastai](https://fast.ai) course by ***Jermy Howard*** which is a deep learning course with fastai library and pytorch.

Prior to that, I graduated from `A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University` as a *Mechanical Engineer*. During my graduation, I have built many projects, led different jobs and had different roles like production engineer to market research. Few of those projects included "an electric car making", "a prototype shrinking chassis", "unconventional traffic solution paper with multi-utility-vehicle concept car".

Going from here with all the practices I gained from data analysis, I am making good use of it towards becoming a data scientist and ml/dl practitioner. During the course of fastai, ***Jeremy Howard*** and ***Rachel Thomas***  had made great points as to why one should blog. After listening to them and reading Rachel's blog on **[Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)** has convinced me to make my own. Hopefully I will contribute my bits to the community.
